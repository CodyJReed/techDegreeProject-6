        Now that we've looked at the architecture
        of the internet, let's see how you might
      </span>
      <span class="2">
        connect your personal devices to
        the internet inside your house.
      </span>
      <span class="3">
        Well there are many ways to
        connect to the internet, and
      </span>
      <span class="4">
        most often people connect wirelessly.

        Let's look at an example of how
        you can connect to the internet.
      </span>
      <span class="6">
        If you live in a city or a town,
        you probably have a coaxial cable for
      </span>
      <span class="7">
        cable Internet, or a phone line if you
        have DSL, running to the outside of
      </span>
      <span class="8">
        your house, that connects you to
        the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.

      <span class="9">
        If you live far out in the country,
        you'll more likely have
      </span>
      <span class="10">
        a dish outside your house, connecting
        you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or
      </span>
      <span class="11">
        you might also use the telephone system.

        Whether a wire comes straight from
        the ISP hookup outside your house, or
      </span>
      <span class="13">
        it travels over radio
        waves from your roof,
      </span>
      <span class="14">
        the first stop a wire will make once
        inside your house, is at your modem.
      </span>
      <span class="15">
        A modem is what connects the internet
        to your network at home.
